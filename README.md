# Some  Peripherals Driver for STM32

This project contains some peripherals driver for **STM32F407VG**. These peripherals are General Purpose Input Output (GPIO), External Interrupts (EXTI), Serial Prepheral Interface (SPI), Universal asynchronous receiver-transmitte (UART) as well as clock settings. I am forming ADC driver now. You could check source codes and headers on my repository. This driver has been written looking at the **STM32F407VG** reference manual.
